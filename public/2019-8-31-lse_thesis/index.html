<p><em><strong>This research was my graduate thesis (Merit) from the Department of Media and Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There is a growing trend in China where Boys&rsquo; Love novels, featuring romantic stories between gay men, are experiencing significant popularity among female readers. However, these novels also face ongoing regulations by authorities. Issues of gender and homosexuality have been a topic of discussion for over ten decades, with close connections to power and hegemony.</p>
<p>This study proposes the following research question: &ldquo;In the Chinese context, to what extent do representations of male characters in Boys&rsquo; Love fiction challenge gender hegemony?&rdquo;  To explore this question, critical discourse analysis will be employed alongside interviews with [readers/authors/both]</p>
<p>Three of the most popular Boys&rsquo; Love fictions were selected from Jinjiang Literary City, a leading online literary website in China, for critical discourse analysis. Passages focusing on character interactions (e.g., dialogues, romantic scenes) were extracted from these novels. Additionally, ten female readers of Chinese Boys&rsquo; Love novels were interviewed through online messaging applications. These semi-structured interviews, lasting approximately one hour, focused on their reading motivations and preferences and included their comments on the extracted materials for critical discourse analysis.</p>
<p>The critical discourse analysis of the selected samples employed a multi-layered approach, examining the texts themself (textual), the language used to construct meaning (discursive), and the broader social context in China (societal).  Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts further enriched the understanding. The dissertation concludes that Boys&rsquo; Love narratives in China can be seen as a form of negotiated resistance against gender hegemony in a patriarchal society. While they may not entirely dismantle traditional gender roles, these narratives offer alternative portrayals of masculinity and potentially challenge some aspects of societal expectations.</p>
