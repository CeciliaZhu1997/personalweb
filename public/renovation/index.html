<p>I led a very meaningful project during my three-year work experience at Xiaomi. The project involved using Xiaomi Smart AIoT products to renovate the homes of brand users for free who were in need.</p>
<p>The participants in this project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A poor but lovely family from the Philippines. The elder daughter registered for the event and asked if we could provide her with a better study environment and reduce her mother&rsquo;s burden.</li>
<li>A couple from Vietnam who adopted several children and are seeking better living environments for the kids.</li>
<li>A doctor from Italy who contributed significantly during the pandemic and wishes to have a relaxing home environment for himself and his mother.</li>
</ul>
<p>My role in this project was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish Activity Mechanism</strong>: Set up event landing pages and create a complete event process, including recruiting candidates, screening, contacting interior designers, and completing home renovations based on candidates&rsquo; needs. Ensure the delivery of products and on-site renovations globally, including in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce and Plan Promotional Content</strong>: Film the renovation process and develop a dissemination plan. Execute the promotion across multiple social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The event and relevant videos/posts achieved significant influence globally, reaching over 18 million impressions, 10 million views, and over 50 thousand registrants in total. Here are some of the videos produced under my supervision:</p>
