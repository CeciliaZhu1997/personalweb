<p><em><strong>This research was my undergraduate thesis (Distinction) from the School of Journalism at the Renmin University of China.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In November 2017, the murder case of Jiang Ge, a Chinese female student studying in Japan, garnered long-term attention on Chinese social media platforms. We-Media, particularly WeChat subscription accounts, played a significant role in capturing public attention, setting the agenda for discussions, and disseminating information during the trial. This paper aims to explore how We-Media writing skills have innovated and developed, using the depictions of the Jiang Ge murder case from WeChat subscription accounts as a case study.</p>
<p>The definition of We-Media has expanded beyond citizen reporters involved in news production to encompass individuals or organizations acting as media in a broader sense. This study analyzes the writing skills of We-Media and its impact on the Jiang Ge murder case, examining the perspectives of both producers and consumers, the public, and the case&rsquo;s victims. Qualitative content analysis of 119 of the most influential WeChat subscription account articles from November to December 2017 reveals that these articles employ increasingly sophisticated writing techniques. Thematically, emotional appeals predominate over legal analysis, with articles emphasizing notions of emotional justice being more widely disseminated. Titles prioritize captivating presentation over neutral tone, offering rich and emotionally charged perspectives from individual viewpoints. Inversion is frequently used in titles, while fragmented writing featuring personal emotions is prevalent in the main body of the articles.</p>
<p>The sustained social media conversation surrounding the case provided a continuous supply of factual information. To analyze how We-Media operates within these dynamic contexts, this paper specifically examines the WeChat subscription account &ldquo;Wang Zhian&rdquo;. Their writing techniques showcase a comprehensive planning approach, incorporating multimedia elements like audio, text, and images to present content.  These techniques effectively target popular issues and capture the audience&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>In conclusion, articles about the Jiang Ge murder case on WeChat subscription accounts reflect broader trends in We-Media writing. The most popular accounts exhibit a strong confirmation bias, shaping public opinion through the reinforcement of existing beliefs. The prevalence of emotionally charged content in these We-Media articles highlights a significant shift towards a more <strong>sensationalized</strong> style of journalism.  Furthermore, the fragmented nature of information dissemination on these platforms can accelerate the spread of rumours.</p>
