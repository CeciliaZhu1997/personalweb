Xiaomi POP Run is a highly successful domestic marketing campaign that has been held several times in China, encouraging users to adopt healthy lifestyles.  In 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions, I spearheaded a virtual run contest to promote exercise and well-being at home. This online event garnered impressive global participation, attracting over 27,000 users over a three-week period. Building on this success, we organized smaller-scale offline POP Run events in 2022, which were also well-received.
