Hello!

I’m Dongdong, a research master’s student in [Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/research-masters/communication-science/communication-science-research-msc.html). My research focuses on the social implications of artificial intelligence and algorithms, viewed through critical lenses such as feminism and decolonial digital activism. I use computational methods to conduct this work.

Prior to this, I completed my first master’s degree at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/about-lse) and my bachelor’s degree at [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/about.html#about2). Motivated by a desire to know the causes of things — a principle I adopted at LSE — I returned to academia at 25 after four years of career exploration in the tech industry.
