## Introduction

Conspirituality is a politico-spiritual philosophy from Ward and Voas (2011) which draws attention towards the idea that individuals interested in spirituality and alternative belief systems exhibit flexibility towards traditional belief systems or organizational structures and privilege alternative, even deviant or stigmatized, claims to truth. These individuals, therefore, run the risk of entertaining or promoting various conspiracy theories online. Our project examines this phenomenon within the context of algorithm-dominated platforms (i.e. TikTok) to further understand how people come to know their own social, political, and religious/spiritual realities. Further, the dynamic of humanalgorithm relations introduces an additional layer of complexity in the formation of ideas related to algorithms. This curiosity can be best described by the idea of algorithmic conspirituality which brings together ideas related to faith in algorithms, spirituality, and conspiracy (Cotter et al., 2022).

Such faith in algorithms, however, troubles their place within contemporary digital infrastructure as they are granted divine precedence and omnipotent power. Taking conspirituality and algorithmic conspirituality as their launch points, this project was an exploration in two parts. First, drawing from Ward and Voas' (2011) politico-spiritual philosophy 'conspirituality,' this project offers a critical lens on the role that algorithms play in disseminating conspiritual content on TikTok. Second, drawing from Cotter et al.'s (2022) notion of 'algorithmic conspirituality,' this project seeks to critically investigate the role that users on TikTok play in deifying its recommendation algorithm and the dangers of such engagements.

Central to TikTok's design is the curated, auto-play feed of the 'For You' page (FYP). We begin by exploring the algorithmic dissemination of conspirituality within the FYP through a series of new, personalized accounts and varied prompting strategies. Our prompting also ventures beyond TikTok's 'For You' page and into the sonic and visual features of the platform. In doing so, we observe the powerful role these features play in directing the transmission of affect and knowledge as well as producing, circulating, and shaping discourses online. Across each subgroup of this project, we unravel the energetic forces which shape user scrolling experiences and delve into a potent realm where digital, political, and miraculous healing experiences intertwine.

## Individual Work

We investigated the algorithmic recommendation system of the TikTok platform, specifically focusing on spirituality. To carry out our study, we created a blank account with a birth year set to 2000. Using this account, we searched for the keyword "spiritual awakening" and watched the top 29 most popular videos out of a total of 396 search results, based on view count.

We observed that each video's webpage included a "You may like" (YML) section, randomly clicked and viewed one video from the YML section, which directed us to a detailed page for that video along with a new set of YML content. Using the web scraping tool Zeeschuimer, we collected the videos listed in the YML section. We repeated this process six times, gathering a total of 128 videos. To analyse the data, we created a Gephi edge table CSV file. We treated each of the six clicked video IDs as sources, while their respective YML video IDs were considered targets.

This CSV file was then imported into Gephi for in-depth analysis. To simplify our analysis, we treated each video as a node and its connections to other videos as edges. By calculating the in-degree of each node, we determined the number of times a video was recommended in the "You May Like" (YML) section. To clarify, the "in-degree" refers to the number of connections or recommendations that a particular video receives from other videos in the TikTok "You May Like" section. It is a measure of how frequently a video is suggested to users based on the algorithm's recommendation mechanism. Nodes with higher in-degree rankings received more recommendations and consequently had a greater chance of exposure on users' YML pages.

In contrast to traditional social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook, where content dissemination relies heavily on user shares, TikTok's recommendation system incorporates a combination of factors such as the number of likes, plays, and the author's followers to generate recommended content. Our preliminary findings reveal that the top 17 videos with the highest in-degree, indicating they were recommended more frequently than others in the dataset and received greater user exposure, have an average of 1 million likes, 10 million plays, and 2 million followers.

Interestingly, one of the most exposed videos has lower numbers in these metrics but shares the same author as the researcher's most viewed videos, suggesting that the author is another factor considered in the recommendation system.
