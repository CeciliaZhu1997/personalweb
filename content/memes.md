## Individual Work

Created in 2017, r/PoliticalCompassMemes grew in popularity in 2020 as a space to classify political ideologies by locating all manner of phenomena - from the welfare state to Wojak avatars - on the political compass image macro. The memes address political style instead of political substance, treating issues and events as occasions to recalibrate the compass. Our analysis yielded four main findings: 1) 'meta' and 'based" memes that give insight into group identity and interplay between groups, 2) how symbols, public figures, and signs are remixed and utilized to build identity within the subreddit at large and within the political categories, and 3) how issue spaces provide insight into a politics of (memetic and stylistic) participation rather than serious political engagement.

While I worked in Subgroup 1, our group specifically used PixPlot to explore visual semantic space. Since the dataset of political compass memes was collected before the summer school, we focused on applying different methods of analysis to make sense of the data: mixed methods with the combination of quantitative methods using 4CAT and Pixplot as well as qualitative analysis. For each flair, we generated a random sample of 2000 memes to narrow the sample size. We then processed those random flair-based samples in Pixplot to get the clusters based on similarities of memes.

Next, using the Pixplot as our foundation, we applied a qualitative analysis of the frequent semiotic resources in each group of memes. We looked through all the clusters from each flair and categorised frequent types of semiotic resources coded into memes. After we classified the clusters of semantic resources and symbols, we performed a comparative analysis based on flairs to figure out how serious political concepts are translated into memes. Three frequent types of semiotic resources can be identified in each flair: public figures, flags, and symbols.
