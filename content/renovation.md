I led a very meaningful project during my three-year work experience at Xiaomi. The project involved using Xiaomi Smart AIoT products to renovate the homes of brand users for free who were in need.

The participants in this project include:
- A poor but lovely family from the Philippines. The elder daughter registered for the event and asked if we could provide her with a better study environment and reduce her mother's burden.
- A couple from Vietnam who adopted several children and are seeking better living environments for the kids.
- A doctor from Italy who contributed significantly during the pandemic and wishes to have a relaxing home environment for himself and his mother.

My role in this project was as follows:

- **Establish Activity Mechanism**: Set up event landing pages and create a complete event process, including recruiting candidates, screening, contacting interior designers, and completing home renovations based on candidates' needs. Ensure the delivery of products and on-site renovations globally, including in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

- **Produce and Plan Promotional Content**: Film the renovation process and develop a dissemination plan. Execute the promotion across multiple social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok.

The event and relevant videos/posts achieved significant influence globally, reaching over 18 million impressions, 10 million views, and over 50 thousand registrants in total. Here are some of the videos produced under my supervision:
