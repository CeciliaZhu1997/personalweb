This is a very special campaign as it is my first time working independently as a project manager, just six months into my first full-time job. We completed a global marketing event -- inviting our users from every time zone in the world to celebrate New Year together!

<h4>Introduction</h4>
The campaign, titled Xiaomi POP - 24 New Years, hosted a 24-hour livestream starting from New Zealand, where the time is the earliest (GMT+12) and has the very first New Year worldwide, and ended at Aitutaki, one of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific (GMT-10), the last time zone globally. From each time zone, we invited one individual or a group of brand users (actual users, not actors) to join the livestream and record their moments as the new year arrived. A total of 34 cities and 102 users from around the world participated, and the livestream ultimately garnered over 102 million impressions and 2 million clicks.<br>

<h4>My Responsibilities</h4>
Of course, this was a very challenging campaign for the project manager, but also inspiring, especially for someone who just started her career. I began preparing for this project in October 2020, and over the next two months, I completed the following tasks:

- **Creative Planning**: Developed activity ideas and planned event content, such as 24-hour live stream materials, promotional plans, and product promotion strategies during the event.
- **Activity Execution**: Coordinated project compliance applications to ensure global implementation; built the live stream webpage; created promotional content for various social platforms; set up offline event venues for live stream recording; produced and sent event-related gifts to participating users.
- **Project Management**: Led a team of 10, collaborating with Xiaomi's 14 regional market teams, legal department, development department, and 18 other teams to ensure the smooth execution of the event.

And the thing I am most proud of: finding 102 brand users who were willing to join us! 

<h4>Feedback from Users and Audiences</h4>
The campaign was a success and received many heartfelt comments from audiences worldwide.<br>

I haven't used any Xiaomi products so far but I hope to use one soon, consider that one of my New Year's wishes. After this amazing event though, I very much feel like part of Mi Family.
More success!<br>
